A: 7p2.2
A: 10q23.1
A: 19q13.2
E: The gene occurs on Chromosome 7. Remember that the entry in OMIM you are looking for starts with a *

Q: What is the accession ('entry') code for the human CFTR protein?
C: P13569
A: CFTR_HUMAN
A: P05109 
A: P26361
E: The accession code will be a set of characters and digits - commonlly P, Q or O followed by 5 digits.

Q: How many amino acids are in the canconical form of the CFTR_HUMAN protein?
A: 168142
A: 13569
C: 1480

Q: What is the gene name for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator?
C: CFTR
A: Cftr
A: ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 7
N: Note: Human gene names are always in upper case. Murine gene names appear in mixed case.

Q: What is the key function of CFTR?
C: Transport of chloride ions
A: Transport of potassium ions
A: Transport of sodium ions
E: The relevant functional information is at the top of the Function description.

Q: How many predicted trans-membrane regions does the CFTR protein have? 
A:        2
A:        7
A:        11
C:        12
E: Ensure you are counting the number of transmembrane helical regions not the numer of transmembrane domains.
N: Note: It is often difficult to solve the structure of trans-membrane proteins. You will see that several structures have been solved for the CFTR protein, but these are of intra-cellular or extra-cellular domains.

Q: Which of these statements is true?
A: Humans have fewer enzymes for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis than <i>M. genitalium</i>
C: Humans have more enzymes for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis than <i>M. genitalium</i>

Q: What is the Enzyme Classification number for phosphofructokinase?
A:        3.1.3.11
C:        2.7.1.11
A:        5.3.1.9
A:        4.1.2.13
N: Note: There is another enzyme (pfkC) with a different EC number. The last field of the EC number defines the specificity of the enzyme. pfkC is depended on the presence of ADP which is not required by pfkA and pfkB

Q: How many different orthologous families of PFK genes are present in <i>E. coli</i>?
A: 1
C: 2
A: 3
E: Use the browser search function on the Kegg page to see how many times 'ECO:' occurs (expand each of the 'show all' links first).

Q: What is the UniProt accession code for <i>E. coli</i> pfkA?
A: POA796
C: P0A796
A: PO6999
A: P06999
E: Remember to look at pfkA not pfkB and to check whether you have a 0 or an O in the accession code.

Q: How many amino acids are present in the <i>E. coli</i> protein?
C: 320
A: 963

Q: How many bases are present in the <i>E. coli</i> open reading frame (including the stop codon)?
A: 320
C: 963

Q: For the supplied prokaryotic DNA sequence, which was the correct 6-frame translation frame?
A:      Forward (5'3') reading frame 1
C:      Forward (5'3') reading frame 2
A:      Forward (5'3') reading frame 3
A:      Reverse (3'5') reading frame 1
A:      Reverse (3'5') reading frame 2
A:      Reverse (3'5') reading frame 3

Q: For the FASTA search using the <i>E. coli</i> pfkA protein, other than <i>E. coli</i>, which species has 100% identity?
A:      Buchnera ...
A:      Enterobacter ...
C:      Shigella ...
A:      Photorhabdus ...
A:      Salmonella ...
E: Scroll down through the results until you find the first entry which has a name other than XXXX_ECOXX

Q: In K6PF1_ECOLI, how many sequence conflict records were there?
A: 1
A: 2
A: 3
C: 4
A: 5

Q: From the paper on the <i>E. coli</i> pfkA paper, what was the source of data that led to these sequence conflicts?
C:      The sequence derived from the nucleic acid sequence
A:      Mutations
A:      X-ray crystallographic data

Q: What is the function of sequence masking?
C:      To remove 'low complexity' regions or 'simple sequences'
A:      To remove 'high complexity' regions

Q: What is the difference between a cladogram and a phylogram?
A:       A cladogram is rooted while a phylogram is unrooted
C:       Both show common ancestry, a phylogram also shows the amount of evolutionary change
A:       Only a phylogram is a phylogenetic tree
